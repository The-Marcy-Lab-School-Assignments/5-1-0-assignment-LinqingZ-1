# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance methods and properties are defined within the constructor function of a class or directly within the class body using the this keyword. They are specific to an instance of the class, meaning each object created from the class has its own separate copy of these methods and properties. Instance methods and properties are used to perform operations or store information that is relevant to the particular instance.

Class methods and properties, on the other hand, are defined using the static keyword within the class body. They belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class. This means they can be called without creating an instance of the class. Class methods and properties are typically used for functionality that is relevant to the class as a whole, rather than to individual instances, such as utility functions or configuration settings.
