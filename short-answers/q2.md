# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer
In a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship, one class (the "parent") can have multiple instances of another class (the "children"), while each instance of the child class belongs to exactly one instance of the parent class. A common example of this relationship is between a Blog and Post classes, where a single blog can have many posts, but each post belongs to one blog.
